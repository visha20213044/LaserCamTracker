# LaserCamTracker
LaserTracker is a Python-based system for real-time laser point tracking using computer vision techniques and servo control. It detects and tracks a laser point within a video feed, adjusting the position of a camera mounted on servo motors to keep the laser centered on a detected circular reference point.
